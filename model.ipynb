We use the car to go every where rather it's to the grocery store , work or just to go hang out with friends and family! Just traveling in general. Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.\\n\\nOMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word \\\"car\\\" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with. I think that if we limit the usage of cars a lot of people in the community will be alot happier. According to the article\\n\\n\\\"Car-free Cities\\\"\\n\\nby\\n\\nElisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says \\\" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\\\" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.\\n\\nIn addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing\\u00a0 because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.\\n\\nLast but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons. Like it will make people less stressful and\\u00a0 be happier, there will be less accidents on the road and it will also help the environment a lot. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0    \",\n          \"Imagine being a top scientist at NASA and Viking 1 spacecraft \\\"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\\\" A lot of people thought of alien life possibility, but others thought it to be just a natural landform. What would your thoughts be about the image? The face of Mars is a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.\\n\\nTo begin, there are similar landforms on Earth to the one on Mars. As stated in the text, \\\"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\\\" Also stated in the text is Garvin giving his opinion, \\\"it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\\\"\\n\\nAnother issue with the alien life theory is the fact that NASA has high quality cameras. Quoting the text, \\\"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\\\" In the result of having high quality pictures you could see small details clearly. As stated in the article Garvin said, \\\" 'so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!' \\\" Concluding that statement nothing other than the landform that had resembled a face was seen on Mars.\\n\\nFinally, there wasn't enough evidence to support the claim of alien life on Mars. The first pictures were blurry and had haze or cloud coverage. This theory was more popular on the online world than in the science world. As stated in the text, \\\"the 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\\\" This proves that this might be just for publicity and attention. There has been many conspiracy theorists.\\n\\nUltimately, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.       \",\n          \"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.\\n\\nOut of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a \\\"human\\\" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.\\n\\nTo conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.        \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          4,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I will be explaining how the \\\"face\\\" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.\\n\\nFirst off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.\\n\\nNext, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?\\n\\nFinaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the \\\"face\\\" is just a landform.\\n\\nTo sum all this up the \\\"face\\\" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.\",\n          \"Dear, State Senator\\n\\nThis is a letter to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.\\\"There are many reasons to keep the Electoral College\\\" one reason is because it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, and the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\\n\\nI am in favor of keeping the Electoral College because,it is widely regarded as an anachronism. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canaditdate who receives the most populare votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).\\n\\nAnother, reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canadate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\\n\\nLast but not least, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A larger state gets more attintion from presidential canadidates in a campaign than a small state does. It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state. But of  course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible American population did vote in the [2012's] election.\\n\\nFrom, PROPER_NAME            \",\n          \"People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.\\n\\nCurrently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely \\\"driverless\\\". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the \\\"driverless\\\" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely \\\"driverless\\\". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more \\\"fun\\\", driving is not meant to be \\\"fun\\\" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have \\\"fun\\\" is just a recipe for disaster.\\n\\nThe idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.\\n\\nThe technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car.

We use the car to go every where rather it's to the grocery store , work or just to go hang out with friends and family! Just traveling in general. Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.\\n\\nOMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word \\\"car\\\" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with. I think that if we limit the usage of cars a lot of people in the community will be alot happier. According to the article\\n\\n\\\"Car-free Cities\\\"\\n\\nby\\n\\nElisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says \\\" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\\\" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.\\n\\nIn addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing\\u00a0 because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.\\n\\nLast but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons. Like it will make people less stressful and\\u00a0 be happier, there will be less accidents on the road and it will also help the environment a lot. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0    \",\n          \"Imagine being a top scientist at NASA and Viking 1 spacecraft \\\"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\\\" A lot of people thought of alien life possibility, but others thought it to be just a natural landform. What would your thoughts be about the image? The face of Mars is a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.\\n\\nTo begin, there are similar landforms on Earth to the one on Mars. As stated in the text, \\\"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\\\" Also stated in the text is Garvin giving his opinion, \\\"it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\\\"\\n\\nAnother issue with the alien life theory is the fact that NASA has high quality cameras. Quoting the text, \\\"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\\\" In the result of having high quality pictures you could see small details clearly. As stated in the article Garvin said, \\\" 'so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!' \\\" Concluding that statement nothing other than the landform that had resembled a face was seen on Mars.\\n\\nFinally, there wasn't enough evidence to support the claim of alien life on Mars. The first pictures were blurry and had haze or cloud coverage. This theory was more popular on the online world than in the science world. As stated in the text, \\\"the 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\\\" This proves that this might be just for publicity and attention. There has been many conspiracy theorists.\\n\\nUltimately, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.       \",\n          \"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.\\n\\nOut of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a \\\"human\\\" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.\\n\\nTo conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.        \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          4,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_essay_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17307,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"people tend use cars much , basically ca n't live get day car . use car go every rather 's grocery store , work go hang friends family ! traveling general . well imagine limited usage cars community ! strongly believe would many advantages community many reasons like make people less stressful time , would less accidents would definitly better environment . omg ran gas oh take car shop get fixed usually two main things hear people stay word `` car '' comes . car comes alot stress expenses take every need usually someone stressed best person wan na conversation . think limit usage cars lot people community alot happier . according article `` car-free cities '' elisabeth rosenthal source lady name heidrun walter says `` car always tense .

The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen\\u00a0like you can get in accidet or\\u00a0the smoke that the car has is bad to breath\\u00a0on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden\\u00a0on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely \\\"car free\\\" but\\u00a0If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called \\\"smart planning\\\". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that \\\"All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change\\\" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called \\\"car reduced\\\"communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this.    \",\n          \"I am a scientist at NASA that is discussing the \\\"face\\\" on mars. I will be explaining how the \\\"face\\\" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.\\n\\nFirst off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.\\n\\nNext, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?\\n\\nFinaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the \\\"face\\\" is just a landform.\\n\\nTo sum all this up the \\\"face\\\" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.\",\n          \"People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.\\n\\nCurrently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely \\\"driverless\\\". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the \\\"driverless\\\" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely \\\"driverless\\\". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more \\\"fun\\\", driving is not meant to be \\\"fun\\\" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have \\\"fun\\\" is just a recipe for disaster.\\n\\nThe idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.\\n\\nThe technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.         \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen\\u00a0like you can get in accidet or\\u00a0the smoke that the car has is bad to breath\\u00a0on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden\\u00a0on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely \\\"car free\\\" but\\u00a0If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called \\\"smart planning\\\". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that \\\"All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change\\\" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called \\\"car reduced\\\"communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this.    \",\n          \"I am a scientist at NASA that is discussing the \\\"face\\\" on mars. I will be explaining how the \\\"face\\\" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.\\n\\nFirst off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.\\n\\nNext, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?\\n\\nFinaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the \\\"face\\\" is just a landform.\\n\\nTo sum all this up the \\\"face\\\" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.\",\n          \"People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.\\n\\nCurrently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely \\\"driverless\\\". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the \\\"driverless\\\" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely \\\"driverless\\\". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more \\\"fun\\\", driving is not meant to be \\\"fun\\\" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have \\\"fun\\\" is just a recipe for disaster.\\n\\nThe idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.\\n\\nThe technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.         \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_essay_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"many people car live . thing n't know use car alot thing happen like get accidet smoke car bad breath someone walk vauban , germany dont proble percent vauban 's families cars , percent sold car move . street parkig , driveways home garages forbidden outskirts freiburd near french swiss borders . probaly wo n't see car vauban 's streets completely `` car free '' lives vauban owns car ownership allowed , two places park large garages edge development , car owner buys space cheap buy one sell space car $ , along home . vauban people completed , said example growing trend europe , untile states else suburban life auto use called `` smart planning '' . current efforts drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailes passengee cars responsible percent greenhouse gas emissions europe percent car intensive united states . honeslty think good idea vaudan makes cities denser better walking vauban , residents within rectangular square mile . artical david gold berg said `` development since world war centered cars , change '' think true david gold said alot thing need cars go anyway cars beacuse people lazy walk place thats alot people use car think good idea vauban people see really n't need car go place place walk need go ride bycles use car . good thik help earth way thats good thing . united states , environmental protection agency promoting called `` car reduced '' communtunties , legislators starting act , cautiously . maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs play much larger role new six years federal transportation bill approved year . previous bill , percent appropriations law gone highways percent transports . many good reason .\",\n          \"scientist nasa discussing `` face '' mars . explaining `` face '' land form . sharing information isue tell . first , could martions drawing . plant life mars rite know , means far know possible type life . explains could made martians . also would martion build face big . make since martian . next , landform . many landforms weird america , also landforms around whole earth . many look like something relate like snake turtle human . landforms earth dont think landforms mars ? course ! ?
